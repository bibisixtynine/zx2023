# zx80
## What is it ?

WARNING : this app is at its very early stage of development... less than ALPHA !

It looks like a smartphone home-screen, and (will) allow the use, (simplified) development, and (easy) share of webapps.

Although this app works online, it is also designed to be installed locally (it is a PWA). It will be then available offline like a 'classic' app ! (see how at the end of this page)

For the installation process, use :
- iPod/iPhone/iPad : Apple Safari
- OSX, Windows, Linux : Google Chrome (or Microsoft Edge)


## how to install zx80.app on any platform ?

Here is [a link for some more info on how to install a PWA webapp](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/content/hearingloss/installPWA.html#:~:text=If%20the%20site%20is%20a,the%20%22three%20dot%22%20menu.)


## PWA install tested on...

- iPhone 13 mini (ios 16.2 and Safari)
- Macbook Air M1 (Chrome 109 and Microsoft Edge 109) osx 12/13/14 (Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma)
- 2013 Nexus 7 tablet - android 6.0.1 and Chrome 100
- iPad Air 2 - iPadOS 14
- HP Pavilion laptop - Linux PopOS 22.04LTS - Chrome 117
- ACER Inspire Laptop - linux EasyOS 5.0

... should work with older Chrome/Chromium / osx version ... but not tested
... should work with older Chrome/Chromium & Edge / Windows version ... but not tested
... should work with Chrome/Chromium / linux version ... but not tested


## Why this app ?

- Target audience : anyone who would like to learn coding and share apps than can be installed on any platform, even with a 'small' iphone 13 mini (I love to code with my iphone mini ðŸ¤“)

- Ease the very begining of the learning curve of coding apps

- No need of developper account, apple store or google store, specific hardware configuration : just a computer, tablet or smartphone with any operating system... able to run Safari (ios) or Google Chrome

- 'modern' javascript is used for coding
